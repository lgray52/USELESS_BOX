# Useless Box
Useless Box Project

Make box with switch that activates a hidden mechanism that turns the switch off

USELESS BOX DESIGN OVERVIEW

Objective:
- Make box with switch that activates a hidden mechanism that turns the switch off
Requirements/Project Description:
- Build a device with at least one panel-mounted SPDT switch on it
- When the switch is flipped, a servo is activated that device flips the switch back
- The mechanism for flipping the switch back is concealed by a door or flap or covering of some sort
- It is controlled by an Arduino
- It is battery-powered
- It is easy to change the batteries.
- It has a power switch which completely kills power to the device
- It has a power indicator
- Everything is securely mounted, with the Arduino mounted on standoffs

- It's a box
- It is constructed from 1/8" (3 mm) acrylic
- It is held together by #4-40 socket head screws and nuts

- Planning
- GitHub

Process:
- Identify goals, resources, and constraints
- Brainstorm solutions
- Do some initial planning and designing, including sketches and a proposed schedule. Be thorough: think through box assembly, servo - mounting, etc.
- Estimate how much material and what equipment will be necessary
- Complete your initial Arduino/servo design using a breadboard
- Then move it over to a protoboard
- Lay out the complete design in CAD, including electronics, nuts, bolts, etc.
- I expect MOST of the parts in your design to be laser cut from 1/8" (3.175 mm) acrylic.
- If one or two of the parts in your design need to be 3D printed, that's cool.
- Optimize the design, so it's rugged but efficiently sized
- Hopefully cut acrylic only once (we'll figure out that part later)

PLANNING


Plan:
  
  Brainstorm
